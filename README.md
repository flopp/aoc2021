My solutions for Advent of Code 2021 in go.

The solution and input data (i.e. my custom input data) for day XX is contained in the subdirectory `dayXX`.
To run the solution for day `XX`, just type

```
make XX
```

This requires a standard Linux system with a default go installation (e.g. Ubuntu 21.10 with the `go` snap package).
